# Four Fields & Evangelism Strategy

## 65. Four Fields – Empty Field
The empty field represents the people or places where the Kingdom has yet to be introduced, a clear target for evangelism and outreach. By identifying these unfilled territories, believers can focus resources on spreading the gospel where it is most needed. The empty field also highlights opportunities for fresh discipleship and community building. It serves as a visual reminder that the Great Commission is ongoing, requiring continuous effort. By mapping these areas, churches can prioritize strategic missions and partnerships. Ultimately, the empty field is a call to action for believers to plant seeds of faith wherever they find them.

## 66. Four Fields – Seeding Field
In the seeding field, believers share the gospel with receptive audiences, planting seeds of faith for future growth. This phase emphasizes intentional outreach and relationship building to nurture new believers. By engaging with those open to the message, disciples can lay a strong foundation for ongoing discipleship. The seeding field also encourages patience and perseverance, as growth takes time and commitment. It reminds believers that evangelism is a process of both giving and receiving trust from those approached. Ultimately, this field represents the initial step in expanding God's Kingdom through heartfelt sharing.

## 67. Four Fields – Growing Field
The growing field involves equipping believers with teaching, discipleship skills, and spiritual maturity to sustain long‑term development. This phase focuses on intentional instruction and mentorship within the community. By providing robust resources, churches help members deepen their faith and become effective leaders themselves. The growing field also fosters a culture of continuous learning, encouraging believers to pursue personal and communal growth. It highlights the importance of nurturing existing disciples rather than merely adding numbers. Ultimately, this stage ensures that the Kingdom thrives through empowered and mature followers.

## 68. Four Fields – Harvesting Field
In the harvesting field, new spiritual families—simple churches—are formed and mature into self‑sustaining communities. This phase celebrates the fruition of discipleship efforts, as believers begin to lead and multiply on their own. Harvesting also involves evaluating the impact of outreach, ensuring that churches remain spiritually healthy and growing. By sharing resources and best practices, the community supports each other's development. The harvesting field reminds us that discipleship is cyclical—planting, nurturing, and reaping. Ultimately, this stage solidifies the church's foundation for future generations of believers.
