# Accountability Groups & Questions

## 12. Accountability Groups
Same‑gender groups of two or three members meet weekly to discuss questions that reveal spiritual growth and areas needing correction. Accountability is a biblical principle—"walk with one another" (Hebrews 10:24)—that keeps believers honest, focused, and connected. These groups provide a safe space for confession, encouragement, and prayer, fostering an environment where growth is nurtured. Regular meetings reinforce commitment to personal discipleship goals and enable members to track progress together. The intimate nature of these groups also cultivates deeper relationships, strengthening the sense of belonging within the church community. Ultimately, accountability groups serve as a practical tool for cultivating spiritual maturity and sustaining mutual support.

## 13. Accountability Group Question 1 – Have you seen God at work?
This question invites participants to recount moments where they felt God's presence or intervention, reinforcing that the Holy Spirit is active in everyday life. By sharing personal experiences of divine involvement, members deepen their awareness of God's ongoing work around them. Such testimonies encourage others to recognize subtle ways God may be guiding their decisions or circumstances. The discussion also serves as a reminder that faith is not static; it continually responds to God's dynamic presence.

By articulating specific examples—such as offering help or speaking truthfully—they become more conscious of their role in God's mission. The exercise fosters a culture of intentional service, encouraging participants to view every interaction as an opportunity for evangelism.
